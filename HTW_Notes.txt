Need to build a data structure to keep track of the hidden parts of the maze

X Outstanding bugs
X line 133 that calls AddTile somehow causes the whole first row to stop rendering
X design flaw or hasn't been designed yet... need a way to control the stacking order
    fyi: the css will display tiles closets to farthest order
